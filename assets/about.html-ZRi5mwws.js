My current research interests focus on quantum information and quantum optics theory in open systems.
Firstly, I am studying the fundamentals of quantum information theory with Dr. Tomotaka Kuwahara, exploring the connection between entanglement entropy and quantum information processing. Now, we are looking for a universal relation between the operator spreading and information propagation. We are attempting to establish a limit for the Holevo capacity using the Lieb-Robinson bound [^1].
Secondly, I am also researching the dynamical behavior of photon transmission [^2] and the entanglement [^3] of photon-phonon pairs based on a nano-optomechanical platform for applying quantum devices. `),v,k,e(" Operator Spreading and Information Propagation Theory in Dissipative Quantum Systems [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] "),C,T,e(" Nonreciprocal Transmission Based on Modulated Optomechanical Systems [^8] "),e(` [^1]: S.
